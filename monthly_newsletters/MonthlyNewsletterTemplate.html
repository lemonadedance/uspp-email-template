                    not just words.

      <p>
        We are on a journey to save our Democracy, as a purely volunteer organization we are task-oriented
        and depend on willing volunteers to put together what needs to be done, do it, and track the process
        of doing it so we can all help one another.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone with a specialized skill-set or who works in any particular industry, we welcome your input and help
        in regards to your specialty, and would encourage you to form a professional group at the National level to 
        collaborate on putting together any issues regarding your professions or industries yourselves.  There are a
        variety of professions with issues and corruption that can be addressed through policy, and we would like to build
        a backlog of issues, which we can hopefully leverage to make an interdisciplinary, strategic, and democratic approach
        for resolving the many issues we face.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to friends who simply want community, and love freedom, privacy, Democracy, and believe this extends to
        all people, we welcome you as well.  Maybe hanging around you will find something you are passionate about, or at
        least you can say you hung out with Pirates once.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Pirates, we do not mind if you only help out when you can or when you feel like it.  Task-oriented strategies
        are ideal for pure volunteer organizations like ours, people have lives to live, and we try not to commit to
        events without volunteers who choose to run it.  Work on what you feel is right to work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a small organization, and you cannot expect professionalism from us, but what you can expect is mostly honest
        people, trying to make things better.  Strategies leveraging open source and fault-resistant strategies, using
        open source approaches and licensing of resources to ensure even if we are taken over forcefully, people will be able
        to keep on going where we left off.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our strategies and actions can and should reflect our values at every step we take, that we do not care about leadership, and 
          we do not need 'leadership' to the extent other parties do.  Leadership often simply means to lead by example,
          this is something that anyone can do within the means of their own capacity and what they know.
      </p>
      <p>
          We do not adhere to excessive heirarchies as other organizations do, and you should not find people preaching
          that we are perfect, or that Pirates can do no wrong.  Mistakes, corruption, takeovers, deceit, if we are being
          honest all of these things can certainly happen anywhere, much less in a political space, and even in a third party.
          People gather in organizations for all kinds of reasons, and all we can do is our best.  Please simply use your
          best judgement, review resources available both from Pirates and other sources, be well informed, do and promote
          the things you do understand and believe in, and let others do so for the things they believe in.
