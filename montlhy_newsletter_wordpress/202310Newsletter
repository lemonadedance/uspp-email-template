<h2> General Information </h2>

    <p>
        We are a collection of state parties, state parties are free to advocate
        for issues or abstain from certain stances at the state level, if they deem it not to be
        useful, viable, or agreeable.  However, full transparency on these differences, and any
        additional stances should be clearly stated on their own platforms.  We will not
        enforce policy approaches people disagree on, however it is expected for states to uphold
        core values of democratic values, privacy, and transparency, and to do so in actions and
        not just words.

        We are on a journey to save our Democracy, as a purely volunteer organization we are task-oriented
        and depend on willing volunteers to put together what needs to be done, do it, and track the process
        of doing it so we can all help one another.
