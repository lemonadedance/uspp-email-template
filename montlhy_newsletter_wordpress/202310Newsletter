<h2> General Information </h2>

    Check out our Platform, Policies, and Core Values for the National level

    <p>
        We are a collection of state parties, state parties are free to advocate
        for issues or abstain from certain stances at the state level, if they deem it not to be
        useful, viable, or agreeable.  However, full transparency on these differences, and any
        additional stances should be clearly stated on their own platforms.  We will not
        enforce policy approaches people disagree on, however it is expected for states to uphold
        core values of democratic values, privacy, and transparency, and to do so in actions and
        not just words.
